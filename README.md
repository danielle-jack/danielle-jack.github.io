## About Me
I'm a recent Information Technology graduate (Class of '25) from Florida State University with a passion for that sweet spot where design meets code! My goal is to build digital experiences that aren't just functional, but actually enjoyable to use.

I looked everywhere online for tutorials and templates and couldn't find anything that interested me, so I designed the site in Figma and built it using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to make it to my liking. I am still learning so the site is still a **work in progress!**

## Stuff I've Made
Here are a few projects I'm involved in that I wanted to highlight. This is just a sneak peek, you can see more details on the website.

### Draw Drills
**What it is:** A web tool that helps artists stop overthinking and start drawing.
**My Role:** I handled the UX research and prototyped the interface in Figma. I focused on "gamifying" the practice sessions with timers and random prompts to help artists build muscle memory.

### NoleScore
**What it is:** A redesign of the FSU Sports app.
**The Problem:** The original app had info scattered everywhere.
**The Solution:** We centralized everything: ticketing, live scores, and student profiles into one clean mobile interface.

### The Chronic Compass
**What it is:** A mobile health app concept.
**My Role:** I designed the gamification elements (like missions and avatars) to make managing chronic conditions feel less like a chore and more like a journey.

### STEM Pathfinder AI
**What it is:** An educational hub for students interested in STEM.
**My Role:** I designed the site architecture and implemented interactive features like career quizzes to help students find their path.
